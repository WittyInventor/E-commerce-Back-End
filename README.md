  ## Description:  
  I made this project in order to learn node in javascript and to generate a professional ReadMe. 
    
  ## Installation: 
Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) package to use environment variables to store sensitive data. (need to edit)

Use the `schema.sql` file in the `db` folder to create your database with MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data like your MySQL username, password, and database name.
  
  ## Usage: 
  After installation, the user sees a list of questions to answer and inputs their answers. After completion of those questions, the ReadMe preview will show all of the information and the users inputted answers.rs
